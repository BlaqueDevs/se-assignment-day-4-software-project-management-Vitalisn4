## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Agile vs. Waterfall:
Agile:
 * Iterative: Breaks project into smaller cycles.
 * Flexible: Adapts to changes throughout development.
 * Customer-centric: Involves frequent feedback.
 * Advantages: Faster delivery, higher customer satisfaction, reduced risk.
 * Disadvantages: Can be challenging for large projects, requires experienced teams.
Waterfall:
 * Sequential: Follows a linear process.
 * Rigid: Less adaptable to changes.
 * Document-heavy: Requires extensive upfront planning.
 * Advantages: Predictable timeline, well-defined requirements.
 * Disadvantages: Slower delivery, increased risk of outdated requirements.

## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Agile is more suitable for:
 * Projects with uncertain requirements: Agile's flexibility allows for adjustments as needs evolve.
 * Smaller teams: Agile's iterative approach promotes collaboration and efficiency.
 * Projects requiring rapid delivery: Agile's incremental approach delivers value quickly.
Example: Developing a new mobile app with uncertain user preferences.
Waterfall is more suitable for:
 * Projects with well-defined requirements: Waterfall's structured approach ensures clarity and consistency.
 * Large teams: Waterfall's centralized control can manage large projects effectively.
 * Projects with strict deadlines: Waterfall's predictable timeline helps meet deadlines.
Example: Building a large-scale infrastructure project with detailed specifications.

## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
Quality assurance methods:
 * Testing: Unit, integration, system, and acceptance testing.
 * Code reviews: Peer review of code for errors and best practices.
 * Static analysis: Automated tool to detect potential issues.
 * Continuous integration: Automated testing with each code change.
Importance of high standards:
 * Customer satisfaction: Quality products meet user expectations.
 * Reliability: Reduces errors and crashes.
 * Maintainability: Easier to update and improve.
 * Cost-effectiveness: Prevents costly rework.

## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
Defining project scope contributes to successful planning by:
 * Clarity: Provides a clear understanding of project goals and deliverables.
 * Focus: Helps prioritize tasks and allocate resources effectively.
 * Cost control: Prevents scope creep and budget overruns.
 * Risk management: Identifies potential challenges and mitigates them.
Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):
 * A hierarchical structure that breaks down a project into smaller, manageable tasks.
 * Benefits:
   * Improved organization and clarity.
   * Efficient resource allocation.
   * Enhanced project tracking and control.
   * Facilitates communication and collaboration.

## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
Benefits of a detailed project schedule:
 * Organization: Provides a clear roadmap for project execution.
 * Time management: Helps allocate resources and track progress effectively.
 * Risk management: Identifies potential delays and allows for contingency planning.
 * Communication: Ensures everyone is aligned on project goals and timelines.
Gantt charts:
 * Visual representation: Depicts tasks, dependencies, and timelines.
 * Easy tracking: Facilitates monitoring progress and identifying potential issues.
 * Resource allocation: Helps assign resources to tasks efficiently.
 * Communication: Provides a clear overview of project status.
